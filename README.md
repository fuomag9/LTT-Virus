# LTT-Virus
__Did you really make me do this?__ This virus will fill every **SINGLE LITTLE FOLDER** in your __ENTIRE__ system with an awesome Linus face (more to come!) until you have **NO SPACE LEFT**. (I've left ~1GB for you because I'm a good dev)

### Disclaimer:

THIS IS A REAL VIRUS AND WILL FUCK UP YOUR SYSTEM, DON'T RUN IT UNLESS YOU'RE IN A VM NOT ATTACHED TO THE INTERNET (it doesn't connect to network devices but just in case) OR YOU'RE A VERY INSANE PERSON

### Tl;Dr:

Don't run it. That's a bad idea. See the source code if you don't believe that it will harm your system.
